# tic-tac-toe-AI
A tic-tac-toe playing program that never loses against a smart player. The program does not use any information about Tic-Tac-Toe beyond the essential rules of how the play it, how to determine legal moves, and how to recognize if the game is a win, loss, or draw.

The program uses a number of random playouts to and chooses the move that resulted in the least number of losses.
A random playout is when the computer simulates playing the game until it is over. During a random playout, the computer makes random moves for each player until a win, loss, or draw is reached. When a playout is done, the result (win, loss, or draw) is recorded, and then some more random playouts are done.
